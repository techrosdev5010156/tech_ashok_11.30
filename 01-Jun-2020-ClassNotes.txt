In Project development we are going to use several tools to improve our productivity

1) Build Tools
---------------
-> Create project folder structure

-> Download required jars

-> Keep Jars on Classpath

-> Compile source code

-> Execute Junits

-> Package Project etc..

-> Ant, Maven & Gradle we can use as Build tools

2) Version Control Tools
--------------------------
-> Code Integration at one place

-> Monitored access (Who, when, why and what)

-> SVN, GIT HUB and BitBucket etc...

3) Code Review Tools
----------------------
-> To identify problems in source code

-> To Improve code quality

-> To reduce bugs in code

-> In project we will have both Manual code review & Automated Code review

-> SonarQube is one of the famous tool for code review

4) Unit Testing Tools
----------------------
-> The process of testing software components individually

-> Unit testing helps to understand behaviour of our components

-> As part of Unit testing we have to test postivie and negative scenarios of our methods

-> As part of Unit testing we will use Mocking

-> Junit we will use as Unit Testing framework for java applications

-> Easy Mock, PowerMock, Mockito, Jmockito we can use these frameworks for mocking

5) Code Coverage Tools
----------------------
-> The process of verifying how many lines of code is executed as part of Unit Testing

-> Code Coverage Report Helps in improving Unit Test scenarios

-> As per industry, we should maintain 85% code coverage

-> Jacocco plugin we can use to measure code coverage

6) Logging Tools
-----------------
-> The process of storing application run time behaviour is called Logging

-> Logging is crucial part of every application

-> Logging helps to understand application behaviour in run time

-> Logging helps to understand exceptions occurred in project

-> Log4J, Logback we can use to perform logging in java applications

7) Log Monitoring Tools
-----------------------
-> Logs files will be geneated in server machine

-> Our servers may not be in same location where we are working

-> To see log messages of our appplication we need log monitoring tools

-> Putty, WinScp and SPlunk for log monitoring

8) Bug Reporting Tools
-----------------------
-> When tester identify a bug then it should be reported (tracking)

-> To report bugs identified in project bug reporting tools will be used

-> BugZilla and Jira we can use as Bug Reporting tools

-> Jira is more than bug repoting tool

-> JIRA can be called as Project Management Tool

-> Agile Projects will be managed by JIRA tool only

9) Performance Testing Tools
----------------------------
-> To identify application responsiveness, stability under serveral work loads we will do performance testing

-> To implement Performance Testing we have to create Virtual Users

-> We have Apache JMETER and HP Load Runner for performance Testing

10) API Testing Tools
---------------------
-> To test SOAP webservices & RESTful services we will use tools

-> SOAP UI is used to test SOAP Provider

-> POSTMAN & Swagger are used to test REST api


11) Memory Analyzer Tool (MAT)
------------------------------
-> Used to analyze JVM memory

12) Reports
-----------
-> To Generate Excel reports we will use Apache POI api

-> To generate PDF reports we will use iText api

13) Message Broker Tools
------------------------
-> To share stream of  data among multiple applications we will use msg brokers

-> Apache Kafka is one of the leading message broker in industry

14) Distributed Cache Tools
---------------------------
-> Cache is used to store data for faster retrival

-> Cache improves performance of the application

-> To share cache data among serveral applications we will go Distributed cache

-> Redis is one of the famous distributed cache


15) Email & OTP
---------------
-> To send emails from java program we will use Java Mail API

-> To send mobile msgs from java program we will use Twillo Api

16) CI & CD
------------
-> CI & CD stands for Continuous integration and Continous deployment

-> To automate application build and deployment process we will Jenkins

-> Jenkins is one of the leading CI & CD tool in the market

17) Containerization
--------------------
-> To deploy application into multiple envrionments we will use Containers

-> Docker is the containerization platform
