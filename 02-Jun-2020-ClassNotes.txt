Version Control Tools
----------------------

-> In Realtime, Project Development will happen with Multiple Developers

-> All developers may not work from same location

-> Every developer will work on different task

Q) How to integrate all the developers code to run our project ?
----------------------------------------------------------------


Q) How to track who created, who modified, when modified, why modified and what modified in source code ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The answer for above two questions is Version Control Tool


-> Version Control Tool provides storage where we can store our source code

-> All the developers can keep their source code in version control tool

-> Version Control Tool provides Monitored access
   (This tool will track changes happening in our source code)

	    		- Who created file
			- When created
			- Why Created
			- Who modified
			- When Modified
			- What Modified
			- Why Modified

-> If we don't use Version Control Tool then Project Development will become Night Mare

-> In Realtime Every Project will use Version Control Tool


There are several Version control softwares are available in market
------------------------------------------------------------------
1) CVS

2) Clease Case

3) SVN

4) GIT HUB (Microsoft)

5) Bit Bucket (Atlasian)

GIT HUB
-------
-> GIT HUB is a cloud platform where we can host our software projects

-> GIT HUB uses GIT as a version control

-> To use GIT HUB we need to create account in GIT HUB

	(www.github.com)

-> Once account is created, we can create multiple repositories in one account

-> For Every project one repository will be created in GIT HUB

-> Repositories can be divided into 2 types
		
			1) public repository

			2) private repository

-> public repository means everybody can see but we choose who can commit

-> private repository means who will choose who see and who can commit
